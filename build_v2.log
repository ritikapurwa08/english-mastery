(node:5184) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///E:/projects/english-mastery/tailwind.config.ts?id=1765608624700 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to E:\projects\english-mastery\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
